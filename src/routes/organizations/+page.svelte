    Future-Proof Your Organization Without the Hype
  </h1>

  <div class="space-y-4 mb-12 text-center">
    <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed">
      The AI revolution is here. But between vendor promises and reality lies a
      gap that only thoughtful engineering can bridge.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 class="text-left mt-12 mb-8">The Challenge You're Facing</h2>

  <div class="space-y-4 mb-12">
    <p class="leading-relaxed">
      Whether you're running a health system, digital health startup, or
      healthcare technology company, you're caught in a difficult position:
    </p>

    <ul class="space-y-3 ml-6">
      <li class="leading-relaxed">
        • Leadership demands "AI strategy" while your team struggles with basic
        integrations
      </li>
      <li class="leading-relaxed">
        • Competitors announce flashy AI initiatives while you wonder what's
        actually working
      </li>
      <li class="leading-relaxed">
        • Legacy systems hold critical data hostage behind outdated interfaces
      </li>
      <li class="leading-relaxed">
        • Your best talent burns out on technology that creates more problems
        than it solves
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="leading-relaxed font-semibold">
      You need to move forward, but you can't afford to get it wrong.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 class="text-left mt-12 mb-8">I've Been Where Your Teams Are</h2>

  <div class="space-y-4 mb-12">
    <p class="leading-relaxed">
      After years inside Epic, Canvas Medical, and 1upHealth, I understand the
      reality behind the curtain. I've built the integrations, debugged the
      interfaces, and watched promising pilots fail because nobody thought about
      the last mile.
    </p>

    <p class="leading-relaxed">
      Here's what I know: <strong
        >Your success with AI depends entirely on your data foundation.</strong
      > Not the AI model, not the vendor's promises - but how well your systems can
      actually share and understand information.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 class="text-left mt-12 mb-8">The Path to Being Future-Ready</h2>

  <div class="rounded-lg p-6 mb-12">
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
      <strong>Real future-proofing means:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul class="space-y-2">
      <li class="leading-relaxed">
        • Solid foundations - clean data pipelines any future system can use
      </li>
      <li class="leading-relaxed">
        • Flexible integrations - standards-based approaches that don't lock you
        in
      </li>
      <li class="leading-relaxed">
        • Incremental wins - small improvements that compound into
        transformation
      </li>
      <li class="leading-relaxed">
        • Clear metrics - knowing what's actually moving the needle on outcomes
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="space-y-4 mb-12">
    <p class="leading-relaxed">
      Instead of betting everything on one vendor's vision, imagine having a
      data infrastructure that makes any AI implementation 10x easier, with
      integration patterns that turn months of work into weeks.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 class="text-left mt-12 mb-8">Why Work With a Solo Engineer?</h2>

  <div class="space-y-4 mb-12">
    <p class="leading-relaxed">
      <strong
        >I offer something the big vendors can't: focus, flexibility, and honest
        engineering.</strong
      >
    </p>

    <p class="leading-relaxed">
      As a solo founder, I move at startup speed with enterprise-grade
      reliability. I'll tell you what will actually work, not what you want to
      hear. No account managers, no telephone game - just direct access to
      someone betting their entire business on making you successful.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="rounded-lg p-8 mt-16 mb-12 text-center">
    <h2 class="mb-8">Let's Build Practical Solutions Together</h2>

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
      I'm looking for healthcare organizations that value pragmatic progress
      over press releases. Whether you're a health system, startup, or
      technology company - ready to invest in foundations, not just flashy
      demos.
    </p>

    <p class="font-semibold mb-8">
      Start with a small pilot project. Low risk, high learning, and a chance to
      prove value before scaling.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="text-center mb-8">
    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
      You don't need another vendor selling AI snake oil. You need an engineer
      who can build solutions that work today while preparing you for tomorrow.
    </p>

      The future of healthcare won't be built by committees - it'll be built by
      small teams moving fast and fixing real problems.

    <p>At Stoa, we're committed to building products that empower users — notably providers, patients, and people that support them. </p>
    <br>

        We're currently working on <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/Stoa-Medical/Portico"><b>Portico</b></a> — an agentic interface engine (In-Progress)
        <br>
        In the future, we'll be building out more products centered around AI and user-experience in healthcare.

        If you have product ideas that your organization would love to see happen, happy to hear and see if we can build it together!

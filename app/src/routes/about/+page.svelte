    Stoa Medical is on a mission to fix how healthcare works.
    <br/>
    Our goal is to build technology that empowers patients, providers, and organizations to make better decisions and improve outcomes. 
    <br/>
    We believe that by combining data, design, and clinical expertise, we can create a new model of care that is more personalized, proactive, and preventive. 
    <br/>
    If you are interested in making a difference in healthcare, we would love to hear from you! Right now it's early bootstrapping, though we plan to raise venture capital at some point.

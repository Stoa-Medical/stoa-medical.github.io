  <h1>About</h1>
  <h2>Stoa Medical is on a mission to fix how healthcare works.</h2>
  <p>
    In ancient Greece, the Stoa was an open space where people gathered to discuss ideas on how to foster wellness.
  
    Times have changed. Technology has given us more optionality than ever, and the modern struggle becomes quality, trust, and mutual respect.

    At Stoa, we believe that technology should be a force for good. We're building innovative technology that empowers patients, providers, and
    people within healthcare organizations to make better decisions and improve outcomes. It's open-source, open-weights, and open-minded.
  </p>
  <p>
    We believe that by combining data, design, and engineering excellence, we
    can create a new model of care that is more <strong
      >personalized, proactive, and consumer-centric</strong
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    Right now, we're <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping#Business"
      >bootstrapping</a
    > and we're commited to building fast and responsibly, something healthcare technology sorely needs. 
    
    It's a team of one + many: a bootstrapped solo founder + engineer dead-set on fixing this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericpan64/">(me, "one")</a> and various collaborators, consultants, and agencies (the "many") that are helping us build the right solution, however long it takes.

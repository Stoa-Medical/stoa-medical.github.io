  <h1>A Stoa for Healthcare</h1>
  <h2>We're on a mission to fix how healthcare works.</h2>
  
  <p>
    In ancient Greece and Rome, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoa">Stoae</a> were open spaces where people gathered openly to exchange ideas and connect.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Times have changed. Technology has given us more optionality than ever, and the modern struggle becomes quality, trust, and mutual respect.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    At Stoa Medical, we believe that technology should be a force for good. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We're building innovative technology that empowers patients, providers, and
    people within healthcare organizations to make better decisions and improve outcomes.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It's built in the open: source-available, open-weights, and open-minded.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We believe that by combining data, design, and engineering excellence, we
    can create a new model of care that is more <strong
      >personalized, proactive, and consumer-centric</strong
    >.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Right now, we're <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping#Business"
      >bootstrapping</a
    > and we're commited to building fast and responsibly, something healthcare technology sorely needs. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It's a team of one + many: a bootstrapped solo founder + engineer dead-set on fixing this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericpan64/">(me, "one")</a> and various collaborators, consultants, and agencies (the "many") that are helping us build the right solution, however long it takes.

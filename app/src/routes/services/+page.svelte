  Stoa Medical offers three tiers to meet your needs:
  <ol>
    <li>Free usage for open-source projects (AGPL license)</li>
    <li>Licensed open-core software for corporate use</li>
    <li>Custom design + development for you ✨ and your team ✨</li>
  </ol>
  We charge fixed-rate per project and offer 1-year post-deployment support (included
  in the price). Unlike traditional devshops that charge per-hour, we believe this
  gets both the best result and the most productive environment for ourselves and
  your team.

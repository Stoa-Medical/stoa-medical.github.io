  <h2>We deliver high-quality software with value-based pricing.</h2>
  Stoa Medical offers three tiers to meet your needs:
  <ol>
    <li>Custom design + development for you ✨ and your team ✨</li>
    <li>Free product usage for open-source projects (AGPL license)</li>
    <li>Licensed product usage for corporate use (Fair Code license)</li>
  </ol>
  We charge fixed-rate per project and offer 1-year post-deployment support (included
  in the price). Unlike traditional devshops that charge per-hour, we believe this
  gets both the best result and the most productive environment for ourselves and
  your team.


  // NOTES BELOW:
  - Products: open-source, but if you want to monetize or use consulting services, legally need to buy license
  - Services: 
    - Product implementation: fixed-rate per project, 1-year post-deployment support included. Can deploy it for you (or you can do it yourself, though will probably take longer)
    - Integration consulting: fixed-rate per hour, $200 USD/hour base. Free 30-minute discovery call / consultation
    - Custom developerment: fixed rate per project, 1-year post-deployment support. Discount on per-project evaluation
  - June 2025: first cohort of customers receive lifetime license and upgrades for free. If you're a healthcare organization looking for the next-generation EHR integration engine, reach-out here

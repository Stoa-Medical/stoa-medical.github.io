    <li>Licensed product usage for corporate use (<a href="https://fossa.com/blog/business-source-license-requirements-provisions-history/">BSL license</a>)</li>
  </ol>
  We charge fixed-rate per project and offer 1-year post-deployment support (included
  in the price). Unlike traditional devshops that charge per-hour, we believe this
  gets both the best result and the most productive environment for ourselves and
  your team.

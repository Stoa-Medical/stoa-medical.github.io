    <h1>Hire intelligent agents (people) that leverage AI agents (code)</h1>
    <br/>
    Stoa Medical is a software agency that:
    <ol>
        <li>Licenses our open-core software for corporate use</li>
        <li>Offers custom design + development</li>
    </ol>
    We charge fixed-rate per project and offer 1-year post-deployment support (included in the price). Unlike traditional devshops that charge per-hour, we believe this gets both the best result and the most productive environment for ourselves and your team.

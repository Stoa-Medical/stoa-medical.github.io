  <h2>We deliver high-quality software with value-based pricing.</h2>
  Stoa Medical offers three tiers to meet your needs:
  <ol>
    <li>Custom design + development for you ✨ and your team ✨</li>
    <li>Free product usage for demos and small teams under the </li>
    <li>Licensed product usage for corporate use (<a href="https://fossa.com/blog/business-source-license-requirements-provisions-history/">BSL license</a>)</li>
  </ol>
  We charge fixed-rate per project and offer 1-year post-deployment support (included
  in the price). Unlike traditional devshops that charge per-hour, we believe this
  gets both the best result and the most productive environment for ourselves and
  your team.

  <h2>Our criteria for good fit</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You're a healthcare organization or provider that is looking to integrate AI with EHRs.
    </li>
    <li>
      You're  looking to build a custom software solution.
    </li>
    <li>
      You support open-source and source-available software.
    </li>
  </ul>
  

  <h2>Limited-time discount</h2>

    For our first 50 customers, we're giving an 80% discount for integration consulting.

    For our first 10 design partners, we're giving an 80% discount on _all_ future software products.

    Note that being a customer is NOT the same as being a design partner.
